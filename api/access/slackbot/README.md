# slackbot

This package implements a simple slackbot using the API provided in the
[`access`](../) package which allows Access Requests to be approved/denied
via interactive slack messages.

## Setup

Run `go build && ./slackbot configure` to print out an example config file:

```toml
# example slackbot configuration file
[teleport]
auth-server = "example.com:3025"  # Auth GRPC API address
client-key = "path/to/client.key" # Teleport GRPC client secret key
client-crt = "path/to/client.crt" # Teleport GRPC client certificate 
root-cas = "path/to/root.cas"     # Teleport cluster CA certs

[slack]
token = "api-token"       # Slack Bot OAuth token
secret = "secret-value"   # Slack API Signing Secret
channel = "channel-name"  # Message delivery channel
listen = ":8080"          # Slack interaction callback listener
```

### `[teleport]`

This configuration section ensures that the bot can talk to your teleport
auth server & manage access-requests.  Use `tctl auth sign --format=tls`
to generate the required PEM files, and make sure that the Auth Server's
GRPC API is accessible at the address indicated by `auth-server`.

*NOTE*: The slackbot must be given a teleport user identity with
apprpopriate permissions.  See the [acccess package README](../README.md)
for an example of how to configure an appropriate user & role.

### `[slack]`

In order to interact with slack, we need a valid bot OAuth token and we need
to be able to receive callbacks from slack when users interact with messages.

A token can be provisioned from [api.slack.com](https://api.slack.com) by
registering an App and associated Bot User for your workspace.

In order to receive interaction callbacks, make sure the `listen` address is
publicly accessible and register it with your App under 
`Features > Interactive Components > Request URL`.

*NOTE*: For debug purposes, slack recommends using `ngrok http` to get a
public HTTPS endpoint for your interaction callback.


## Usage

Once your slackbot has been configured, you can varify that it is working
correctly by using `tctl request create <user> --roles=<roles>` to simulate
an access request.  If everything is working as intended, a message with
`Approve` and `Deny` buttons should appear in the channel specified under
`slack.channel`.  Select `Deny` and verify that the request was indeed
denied using `tctl request ls`.


## Security

Currently, this Bot does not make any distinction about *who* approves/denies
a request.  Any user with access to the specified channel will be able to
manage requests.  Therefore, it is important that access to the channel
be limited.
